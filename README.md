# BINF 6200: Assignment 1

This is my first assignment for BINF 6200

## Description

This assignment consists of 3 programs

1. calc_daltons.py: a simple program that takes a protein sequence in the form of a 
text file and returns its weight
2. calc_number_amino_acids.py: this program takes input in the form of a sequence 
name and the length of the sequence, then returns the length of the sequence, the
length of the decoded protein, and the average weight of the protein sequence
3. dynamic_protocol.py: this program takes inputs in the form of a final solution
volume, a NaCl stock concentration, a NaCl final concentration, a MgCl2 stock
concentaion, and a MgCl2 final concentration. It then outputs directions to
achieve a solution with the specified volume and concentration

## Executing programs

All programs can be called by entering 'python3', followed by the name of the script
'''
python3 calc_daltons.py
'''

## Notes or errors

* The calc_daltons.py script accepts a .txt file, rather than a hardcoded string
* Pylint seems to think I have mixed tabs and spaces in my scripts, which I have not
